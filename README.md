#### Tech Stack: `Python`, `Ptk (GTK4 Wrapper)`

#### Programming Logic
Application comes with main window and sub windows. In these sub-windows, `Gtk.Stack` used. For each stack pages, Gtk widgets are created from functions or classes that is currently under `src/Pages` folder. Application also has responsive mode. If window resize and listbox cannot fit, listbox hides and new navigation buttons appears on header of the application.
